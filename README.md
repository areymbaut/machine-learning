# machine-learning

This repository gathers code ressources related to machine learning.

## Reimplementations
The `reimplementations` directory contains scripts that reimplement basic machine-learning algorithms and neural networks from scratch (_i.e._, using non-machine-learning-specific libraries such as `numpy` or using basic functions from `torch`). Each reimplementation is accompanied by a short demonstration on simple datasets. Here are the algorithms that have been reimplemented:
- basic algorithms
  - linear and logistic regressions.
  - linear regression (using `torch`).
  - Naive Bayes classifier.
  - _k_-means classifier.
  - _k_ nearest neighbors (classifier and regressor).
  - linear support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier.
  - decision tree (classifier and regressor).
  - random forest (classifier and regressor).
  - AdaBoost classifier.
  - gradient-boosted trees (classifier and regressor).
  - single-layer perceptron classifier.
- neural networks
  - fully connected single-layer neural network (using `torch`).
  - convolutional neural network (using `torch`).
  - long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (using `torch`).
